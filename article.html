            Honor is the measure of Arthur's moral standing based on your
            actions. Honor will increase with actions that show kindness, such
            as donating to camp, assisting strangers that are injured or
            stranded in the wild, turning down duels, ect. Actions that will
            decrease honor include stealing, murdering, antagonizing people, and
            other unpleasant actions. Honor affects how other characters in the
            game treat Arthur, and how much shopkeepers charge for items.

            Alcohol flows freely throughout the wild west. Ride up to one of the
            many saloons and order yourself a beer or shot of whiskey. You can
            also find bottles of bourbon, rum, and gin in stores or camps around
            the land. Drinking will refill your Dead Eye core, but drinking too
            much will make Arthur drunk. If you continue drinking, Arthur will
            become wasted and eventually black out.

          <p>
            Dead Eye allows Arthur to focus when he's shooting. When Dead Eye is
            active, time slows down so Arthur can plan out his shots
            effectively. Using Dead Eye will drain your Dead Eye core, which can
            be replenished by drinking alcohol, smoking cigars or cigarrettes,
            drinking coffee, or eating foods flavored with thyme. As you
            progress through the story, Arthur's abilities in Dead Eye will be
            upgraded.

            Arthur can partake in various activities across the frontier. You
            can stop by any river or lake and spend some time fishing. Various
            table top games can be found at saloons or around camp, such as
            dominoes, blackjack, poker, and five finger fillet. Sometimes Arthur
            may happen across a gunslinger who will challenge Arthur to a
            sharpshooting competition.
